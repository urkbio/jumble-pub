## Web Version

You can use the web version of Jumble at [jumble.social](https://jumble.social).

## Desktop Version

You can download the desktop version from the [release page](https://github.com/CodyTseng/jumble/releases). If you want to use Apple Silicon version, you need to build it from the source code.

Because the app is not signed, you may need to allow it to run in the system settings.

## Build from source

You can also build the app from the source code.
